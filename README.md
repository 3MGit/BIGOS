# Welcome to BIGOS
Advanced game engine and rendering technology almost as good as Polish traditional food. Currently supports DirectX11 (Vulkan and DirectX12 support is in development).

## Getting Started
Use Win-GenProjects.bat in "scripts" folder to genetate default Visual Studio 2019 solution

If you are using older version of MS Visual Studio, you need to change Win-GenProjects.bat script:

```lua  
pushd ..\
call ThirdParty\premake\bin\premake5.exe vs2019
PAUSE
```
Possible builds vs2005-2019
